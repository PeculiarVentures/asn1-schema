This package uses ES2015 [decorators](https://medium.com/google-developers/exploring-es7-decorators-76ecb65fb841) to simplify working with ASN.1 creation and parsing. 


## Introduction

Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) is a standard interface description language for defining data structures that can be serialized and deserialized in a cross-platform way. Working with ASN.1 can be complicated as there are many ways to represent the same data and many solutions handcraft, incorrectly, the ASN.1 representation of the data.

`asn1-schema` addresses this by using decorators to make both serialization and parsing of XML possible via a simple class that handles these problems for you. 

This is important because validating input data before its use is important to do because all input data is evil. 


## Installation

Installation is handled via  `npm`:

```
$ npm install @pv/asn1-schema
```

## Examples
Node.js:

```js
```

## API

Use [index.d.ts](index.d.ts) file
